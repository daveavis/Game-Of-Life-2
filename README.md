# Game-Of-Life-2
The classic Game of Life using LibGDX.  This is an improved approach over my first attempt.  This time I use a camera and have the locations based on the camera coordinates rather than pixel coordinates.  There are some things implemented in an odd way.  This is because one goal of this project is to make something I can have my high school students complete where they only need to focus on the game logic, not the graphics.

This was written using BlueJ so I included the `+libs` folder containing the LibGDX jars.
